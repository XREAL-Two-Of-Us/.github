## 💬 About
**TWO OF US** is a two-player collaborative VR experience built on an asymmetric information structure.  
Each player has different perspectives, abilities, and information, and must communicate to solve puzzles and progress.

The project explores how self-understanding and relational awareness emerge through cooperation in immersive XR environments.

<br>

## 🧠 Key Features
- 2-Player Asymmetric Cooperative VR
- Communication-driven puzzle design
- Immersive social VR interaction
- AI-based reflective report after gameplay  
  (interaction + dialogue pattern analysis)

<br>

## 🎮 Gameplay
Players are trapped in a forgotten data island inside a temporary storage system,  
where two residual characters must cooperate to escape the system.

Each player is given a different role, perspective, and information:
- **Explorer** navigates the space in first-person and solves puzzles
- **Prospector** observes from a broader viewpoint and manipulates the environment

Because information is intentionally asymmetric, players cannot progress alone.  
They must communicate, interpret each other’s clues, and build mutual understanding to advance.

### 🧩 Missions
- **Puzzle Block Alignment** – Create paths by rearranging blocks collaboratively  
- **Image Matching** – Combine different visual clues through dialogue  
- **Lever Synchronization** – Coordinate environmental controls to unlock new areas  

The gameplay is designed so that communication is not optional,  
but the core mechanic for progression.
